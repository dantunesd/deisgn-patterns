# Proxy

Sometimes you want to implement some logics to improve performance or security or monitoring and so on. 

Creating a proxy, you can control the calls to the original object. Proxy has a similar structure to Decorators, however, while in decorator you improve the original object, with proxy you control the original object life cycle, calling it either or not.
