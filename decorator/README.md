# Decorator

As vezes criamos objetos simples/basico que tem uma determinada finalidade, por√©m chega um momento onde queremos aumentar sua versatilidade.

Sometimes we create basic objects with simple structures. But there comes a time where we want to improve this structure adding new capabilities.

Creating a Decorator we are able to improve an object, adding new capabilities without having to change it.

Moreover we don't have to change its interface and we also can change, chain or remove these capabilities.
